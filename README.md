Codes describing the evolution of a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into an optical superlattice---Mathematica

The superlattice takes the form 

        V(x) = - A_1 cos^2(k_1 x) - A_2 cos^2(k_2 x + phi)
with A_1, A_2 the optical lattice potential depths and phi is a relative phase. Each of these has an effect on the layout of the band structure. 

Mathematica notebook does not play well with regular text editors. Currently re-writing the code in Python for comparative purposes.


EnergyBand python notebook plots the energy band structure for certain superlattice parameters (taken as input)
